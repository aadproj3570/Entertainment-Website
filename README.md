# Entertainment Website

## Project Description
#### Spring 2023 (Group 7)
#### This is an entertainment website, named UHTv, that functions like a video streaming platform. The purpose of the UHTv is to offer users an alternative to platforms like YouTube and Netflix, where they can view, either by stream or download, different categories of content. Users will be prompted to create an account in order to save their personal information and preferences of viewing content. UHTv will have an interface similar to that of YouTube, with a search engine and a dynamic home page. UHTv will also have a content creator program that will entice creators to post videos in exchange for monetary rewards, without as many family-friendly restrictions imposed by competitors like YouTube. Without these restrictions, creators are allowed to take greater creative liberty, and viewers can expect a wider variety of content on our platform. UHTv will allow users to set preferences whether they prefer family-friendly content. Some of the features our group plans to incorporate on the website include: a Home Page, Favorites, Account, History, Liked, Trending, Categories, and an About Page.
